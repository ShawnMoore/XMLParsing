# XMLParsing
Encoder &amp; Decoder for XML using Swift's _codable_ protocol.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

Navigate to the project directory and create a _podfile_ with the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Inside of your `Podfile`, specify the XMLParsing pod:

```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourApp' do
  # Comment the next line if you're not using Swift and don't want to use dynamic frameworks
  use_frameworks!

  # Pods for Test
  pod 'XMLParsing', :git => 'https://github.com/ShawnMoore/XMLParsing.git'

end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Open the the _xcworkspace_ file that was created. This should be the file you use everyday to create your app, instead of the _xcodeproj_ file.

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

Carthage can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

Inside of your `Cartfile`, specify XMLParsing:

```ogdl
github "ShawnMoore/XMLParsing"
```

Then, run the following command to build the framework:

```bash
$ carthage update
```

Drag the built framework into your Xcode project.

### Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. Itâ€™s integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding XMLParsing as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ShawnMoore/XMLParsing.git", from: "0.0.3")
]
```

## Example

```swift
import XMLParsing

let xmlStr = """
<note>
    <to>Bob</to>
    <from>Jane</from>
    <heading>Reminder</heading>
    <body>Don't forget to use XMLParsing!</body>
</note>
"""
    
struct Note: Codable {
    var to: String
    var from: String
    var heading: String
    var body: String
}

guard let data = xmlStr.data(using: .utf8) else { return }

let note = try? XMLDecoder().decode(Note.self, from: data)

let returnData = try? XMLEncoder().encode(note, withRootKey: "note")
```
